Bean Scopes

1. Singleton ==> Only once per spring container. In our example, triangle would be 
initialized once and a call to getBean() would have give you the same object.

2. Prototype ==> New bean created with every request or reference. Every getBean() or ref creates a new instance

3.WEB_AWARE CONTEXT BEAN SCOPES
===============================
3. Request ==> New bean per servlet request.
4. Session ==> New bean per session.
5. Global Session ==> New bean per global HTTP session.

Aspect - logging aspect a class with special privileges.
You do not reference these aspects in the code.
Define a aspect configuration. 
Make changes to aspect configuration =
enables bulk configs.

Wrapping aspects around methods.
Aspect Code then target method then aspect code.

STEPS IN AOP
**  Write aspects
**  Configure where aspects apply

Spring helps with dependency 



Package names
===================
* aspect
* model (data transfer objects)
* impl (Implementation of the service interfaces)
* service ( Service Interfaces)
*
